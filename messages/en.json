    "title": "About Me",
    "short": "I'm shuntia. A high schooler from the US. I build high-performance systems in Rust and creative tools for audio/video. I value correctness, minimalism, and zero global state.",
    "extended": "I specialize in systems programming (Rust, Tokio), ECS architectures, and performant UI. I build things like Lunaris (a modular video editor) and qdp (a resilience protocol). I run Arch (Hyprland), produce UTAU music, and draw. I have a strict engineering philosophy: strong types, no magic, and absolute reliability.",
