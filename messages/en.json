    "title": "About Me",
    "short": "I’m a high school developer exploring the intersection of systems engineering and creative technology. I enjoy building tools from scratch — video editors, small utilities, and even early-stage protocol concepts. I work in both English and Japanese and like solving problems that feel ambitious for my age.",
    "extended": "My interests span systems programming, multimedia processing, UI motion, and infrastructure concepts. I care about clarity of design, performance, and long-term reliability. I’m especially drawn to projects that combine engineering with creativity — whether that’s building a video editor, shaping a protocol idea, or designing interfaces that feel intuitive and expressive.",
